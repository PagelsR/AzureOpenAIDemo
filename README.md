# Summarized OpenAI models
- GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3): A state-of-the-art language model that can generate human-like text and perform various natural language processing tasks.
- GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2): A previous version of GPT-3 with similar capabilities, but with fewer parameters and a smaller scale.
- GPT-Neo: An open-source alternative to GPT models developed by EleutherAI community that is designed to be more accessible and transparent.
- Codex: A language model developed specifically for code generation and understanding, which can help automate software development tasks.
- CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training): A language model that can understand natural language descriptions of images and can be used for various computer vision tasks.
- DALL-E: A language model that can generate images from textual descriptions.

These models can be accessed through OpenAI's API or by using the open-source code available on GitHub.
